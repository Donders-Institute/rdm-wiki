An Introduction to Research Data Management
*****************

This is an introduction to the purpose, importance, and benefits of proper Research Data Management. 
There are few specific instructions about how to properly manage Research Data on this page. 
Therefore, for those familiar with BIDS and the standards of providing metadata, this page can be skipped over. 

**Research Data Management**
=======

* Defined as the practice of storing, organizing, and maintaining data collected for research purposes

* Research Data Management aims to improve the research efficiency and transparency, and to fulfill the requirements of the university, funders, and legislation.

* Academic research should be FAIR

The FAIR Acronym
-----------
**F** indable

**A** ccessible

**I** nteroperable

**R** eusable


**What Practices Promote FAIR Science?**
=======

Utilizing BIDS Format
-----------
BIDS (or Brain Imaging Data Structure) is the standard directory structure for brain imaging data. This structure is shown below.

``\project\data\subject\session\modality\file.type``

Using BIDS will make your research more FAIR.

Providing Metadata
-----------

Your dataset should provide the information necessary to understand and use it: this is called metadata.

The metadata you provide should answer the 5 **W** s:

1. Who - Who comprised your sample?
2. What - What measures did you use?
3. When - What year did you collect the data? 
4. Where - What institute did you collect the data at?
5. Why - What question were you trying to answer?

Providing answers to these questions in the metadata will enable other researchers to determine what they can do with your data.

Archiving Datasets to Public Repositories
-----------

When it is possible, you should make your data publicly available. For all Donderians, you will be archiving to http://public.data.donders.ru.nl

**What Problems does Proper Research Data Managment Mitigate?**
=======

Risk of Losing Data
-----------
Proper data management practices involve backing data up so that if local copies are lost, the data can still be retrieved

Limited Storage Space
-----------
Proper data management practices ensure that there is the necessary space on local memory

Privacy Violations
-----------
Proper data management practices protect the privacy and anonymity of research participants

Non-Reusability
-----------
Proper data management practices enable data to be reused by future researchers

Inefficienct Analysis Practices
-----------
Proper data managmenent practices free researchers up to do research better, faster, and smarter!
