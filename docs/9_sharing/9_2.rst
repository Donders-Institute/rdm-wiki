Making Data Publicly Available
***************

In the spirit of open science - achieved by making research FAIR - many researchers aim to make their data publicly available. 
Research data should only be made publicly available if potentially identifying information has been removed. 
Some examples of how this is to be done are as follows: 

1. Use anonymized labels (subject numbers assigned via the calendar)
2. De-face and de-ear MRI files

Often, researchers will make 2 DSCs - one to be made publicly available and one which is private. 
Importantly, even the private data may not contain any potentially identifying information: this must be kept apart from the experimental data at all times.
