In order to use many services offered by the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`, you must have access to Trigon. 
Of course the most obvious way to do this is to use a PC with a hard-wired connection from within the building, such as the PC's in the Trainee or Instruction Rooms. 
However, this is also possible to do remotely.
