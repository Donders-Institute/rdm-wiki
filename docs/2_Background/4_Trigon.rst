In order to use the :bdg-success:`RDM` infrastructure and many other services offered by the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`, you must have access to the Trigon Network. 
Of course the most obvious way to do this is to use a PC with a hard-wired connection from within the building, such as the PC's in the Trainee or Instruction Rooms or a DCCN-issued laptop connected to a docking station within the building. 
However, it is also possible to access the network remotely through VPN.
