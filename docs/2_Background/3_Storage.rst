Data Storage Facilities
********

The :bdg-danger:`DCCN` has many :bdg-primary:`data storage facilities` - each with their own advantages and disadvantages. 
Knowing :bdg-primary-line:`where` data can and should be stored, as well as :bdg-warning-line:`when` it should be stored in certain locations is crucial in generating a plan of how you will manage data.

Local Storage
=====

:bdg-primary:`Local storage` involves any local devices such the :bdg-primary:`C:/` drive in your DCCN-issued PC or your personal laptop,
as well as the :bdg-primary:`D:/` drive in lab computers.

.. dropdown:: Advantages 

    Using :bdg-primary:`local storage` can be helpful in multiple :bdg-warning:`stages of the research cycle`. 
    One common use case is if you have a software package that cannot be downloaded on :bdg-primary:`High Performance Storage` - 
    in this case it is best to work with data on your personal PC or on the PC issued to you by the Technical Group. 
    Similarly, if you are collecting data in the lab and you are writing data while the experiment is running, you may wish to write the data to the local 
    storage of the lab computer.

.. dropdown:: Disadvantages

    When conducting analysis on your personal PC or the PC issued to you by the Technical Group, you will need to download your research data onto your device. 
    In such cases, you **MUST** already have anonymized data in case of a data leak from your local storage. 
    Also, downloading all of the research data may take a long time depending on the size of the data set you are analyzing. 
    Similarly, such analyses generally can be run much faster on the :bdg-primary:`HPC cluster` and may require more RAM than your PC has. 
    Finally, your PC can crash at any moment and all data can be lost, so you must constantly re-upload your data to :bdg-primary:`High Performance Storage` 
    to mitigate potential data loss.

Ultimatley, :bdg-primary:`local storage` is risky because data is not backed up anywhere and inefficient for several reason. 
Nonetheless, it does have its use-cases though you always must be careful to prevent data loss and breaches in privacy.
