The :bdg-primary:`High Performance Computing Cluster` (or HPC Cluster) is essentially a large cluster of computers which we use here at the :bdg-danger:`DCCN` to do analyses. 

How to Access the HPC Cluster
=======

If you haven't already done so, you will first need to download `EduVPN`_, `PuTTY`_, and `TigerVNC`_ on the computer you are using and `TIQR`_ on your phone. 
You will also need to have received the Trigon Access token from the Technical Group at the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`.

1. Establish Access to Trigon either via hard-wired connection or `via EduVPN`_ (instructions begin under 'What do i need')
2. Use PuTTY to `open a VNC Server`_
3. Use PuTTY and TigerVNC to `open a remote desktop`_

Key Benefits of Using the HPC Cluster
==========

These computers enable running many different processes in parallel, which massively speeds up your analysis time! 
They also offer much greater working memory or RAM in comparison to what is often found on the average PC. 

The :bdg-primary:`HPC Cluster` is also set up to work with :bdg-primary:`High Performance Storage`.
By accessing the :bdg-primary:`HPC Cluster`, you can run analyses as though using a virtual desktop: 
thus, you don't have to move or download files onto your local PC in order to use the data outside of the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`.

    * Using the :bdg-primary:`HPC Cluster` is often the best way to analyze data
    * Accessing the :bdg-primary:`HPC Cluster` can be easy and efficient once you know what to do
