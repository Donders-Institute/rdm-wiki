Subject Numbers
=========

When you make your booking, you will assign a unique subject-session number to the booking. 
When using the MRI and MEG labs, you will collect your booking under the project-subject-session numbers for the slot that you booked. 
This will be enable the data to automatically be saved to your project folder. 

When saving data from other modalities, you should use this combination of project-subject-session numbers to upload data via the Uploader. 
You should also log your :bdg-info:`Case Report Forms` in castor using the same subject number, as this will make it easier for you to backtrack if data goes missing or you are trying to figure out if something happened during a specific session.
