Defining Research Data Management
========

:bdg-success:`Research Data Management` (RDM) is the practice of managing your research data: 
:bdg-primary-line:`where` it is stored, 
:bdg-secondary-line:`who` has access to :bdg-secondary-line:`what` files, 
:bdg-dark-line:`how` data is moved, 
and :bdg-warning-line:`when` in the timeline of your project. 

Purpose of this Handbook
==========

We created this handbook to teach you everything you need to know about :bdg-success:`RDM` within the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`. 
The :bdg-danger:`DCCN` technical group has streamlined the process of :bdg-success:`RDM` so that you can focus your time and energy on your research! 
However, in order to benefit from this streamlining, you have to learn about our :bdg-primary:`facilities`, :bdg-secondary:`policies` :bdg-dark:`tools`, :bdg-warning:`Workflows`, and :bdg-warning:`Standard Operating Procedures`.

**This handbook contains tutorials which will teach you how to navigate the** :bdg-success:`RDM` **infrastructure in the** :bdg-danger:`DCCN` **so that you can run your project efficiently and in compliance with our policies.**

Other Research Data Management Resources
===========

This handbook is intended to be very practical, so we will most ignore the theoretical side of :bdg-success:`RDM`. 
Therefore, throughout the handbook we will link you to more resources which talk about these both at the `DCCN level`_ and the `University level`_
