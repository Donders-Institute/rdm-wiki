What is Research Data Management?
========

Simply put, Research Data Management (RDM) is the practice of managing your research data: where it is stored and who has access to which files, over the entire timeline of your project. 

Why the Handbook?
==========

We created this handbook to teach you everything you need to know about RDM within the DCCN. 
The DCCN's technical group has streamlined the process of RDM so that you can focus your time and energy on your research! 
However, in order to benefit from this streamlining, you have to learn about our tools, workflows, and 

**This handbook contains tutorials which will teach you how to navigate the RDM infrastructure in the DCCN so that you can run your project efficiently and in compliance with our policies.**

Other Research Data Management Resources
===========

This handbook is intended to be very practical, so we will not cover the more theoretical side of RDM. 
Therefore we will link you to more resources which talk about these both at the DCCN level and the University level
