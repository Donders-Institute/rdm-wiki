Defining Research Data Management
========

:bdg-success:`Research Data Management` (RDM) is the practice of managing your research data: 
:bdg-primary-line:`where` :bdg-primary-line:`what` data is stored,
for :bdg-primary-line:`how long`, 
:bdg-info-line:`who` has access to :bdg-info-line:`what` files, 
:bdg-dark-line:`how` data is moved, 
:bdg-warning-line:`which` rules apply,
and :bdg-info-line:`when` in the timeline of your project. 

Purpose of this Handbook
==========

We created this handbook to teach you everything you need to know about :bdg-success:`RDM` within the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`. 
:bdg-danger:`DCCN` support staff continuously works on streamlining the :bdg-success:`RDM` procedures so that you can focus your time and energy on your research! 
However, in order to benefit from this streamlining, you have to learn about our :bdg-primary:`facilities`, :bdg-dark:`tools`, :bdg-warning:`Workflows`, and :bdg-warning:`Standard Operating Procedures`.

**This handbook contains tutorials and practical guidelines which will teach you how to navigate the** :bdg-success:`RDM` **infrastructure in the** :bdg-danger:`DCCN` **so that you can run your project efficiently and in compliance with relevant policies.**

Other Research Data Management Resources
===========

This handbook is intended to be very practical, so we will most ignore the theoretical side of :bdg-success:`RDM`. 
Therefore, throughout the handbook we will link you to more resources which talk about these; both at the `DCCN level`_ and the `University level`_.
