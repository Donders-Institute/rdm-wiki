Once you have completed data collection, you are supposed to do one import thing to wrap up the :bdg-warning:`Collecting Data` stage. 
You are supposed to archive your :bdg-primary:`Data Acquisition Collection`. 
Archiving these collections is akin to publishing them: it means that no more data will be added. 
Archiving these :bdg-primary:`Data Acquisition Collections` is the same process as other collections, but you should **almost always** set these collections to ``Closed Access`` to ensure that no potentially identifying information is leaked. 

Read about `how to archive your`_ :bdg-primary:`Data Acquisition Collection` if you haven't already done so before.
