Archiving Your Project's DAC
********

.. _how to archive your: https://data.ru.nl/doc/help/helppages/user-manual/archive-publish/archive-dac-rdc.html

Once you are sure that you have completed the :bdg-info:`Data Collection`, you are supposed to do final thing. 
You are supposed to archive your :bdg-primary:`Data Acquisition Collection`. 
Archiving these collections is akin to publishing them: it means that no more data will be added. 
Archiving these :bdg-primary:`Data Acquisition Collections` is the same process as other collections, but these collections can only be set to :bdg-warning:`Closed Accesss`` - you will have the option to set metadata visible to non-viewers though. 

Read about `how to archive your`_ :bdg-primary:`Data Acquisition Collection` if you haven't already done so before.

.. Warning::

    Although they are always :bdg-warning:`Closed Accesss`, you **CANNOT** include potentially identfying data in these :bdg-primary:`DACs`. 
    This especially includes documents which include emails, names, phone numbers, or SONA IDs: these may never be stored with research data.
