Collecting Data
********

:bdg-info:`Collecting Data` is the next stage in the Research Life Cycle. 
It begins with the scheduling of the first participant until archiving of raw data following the final participant. 
In this section, we'll inform you of the :bdg-success:`RDM` practices in the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`: 
what the governing :bdg-info:`policies` are, how you can most effectively make use of our :bdg-dark:`tools` and :bdg-primary:`infrastructure`, and which :bdg-warning:`workflows` you should be aware of.
