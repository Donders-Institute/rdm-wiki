Using Castor
**********

By now, you will have already created :bdg-info:`Case Report Forms` which will be available on Castor. 
Let's say that you have just brought in your first real participant into the lab. 

After having the participant fill out the informed consent form, you will then want to open Castor at https://data.castoredc.com/ 

Using Castor for Screening
========

1. Open your study (this must already be set to ``Live``), then go to ``Participants``
2. Push the ``+ New`` button on the top right and put the subject number in (from the Calendar)
3. Let the participant fill in any relevant sections in your :bdg-info:`Case Report Form` such as screening and the general information sections

Using Castor for Documentation
==========

Throughout the session, you should document any incidents (or lack thereof) on the respective sections of the :bdg-info:`Case Report Form`
