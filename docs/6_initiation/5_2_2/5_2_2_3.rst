Exercise 3: Download data from a collection you have been added to with Repocli
*****************************************************

Once you have been added to a collection, you will receive an email to the email account you used when you signed up to the Donders Repository stating that you have been added. 
We have added you to the ``DSC_3010000.05_519`` collection - a private DSC - so that you can get practice downloading privately shared data. 
You should never download private DSCs onto your personal computer to ensure that - if the researchers made a mistake - there are no chances of data leakages. 
We will practice downloading this DSC onto your Home Drive (replace groupname with your lab group's name and firlas with your DCCN username)
