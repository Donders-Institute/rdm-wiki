How to Obtain Access to Donders Repository Collections
**************************

To obtain access to Collections in the Donders Repository, you must contact one of the managers of that collection. 
For all DCCN Collections, you can see who the manager(s) are for each collection of each project: you should contact any one of those people and request to be added. 

For DCN, DCC, and DCMN Collections, you will only be able to see who the manager(s) are for each collection if that collection is a publicly available DSC. 
Importantly, not all researchers publish their collections as publicly DSCs. 
Therefore, if you have become aware of a data set collected by a member of the Donders Institute which you would like to analyze, you should just contact a member of that project to ask about if/how you might receive access.
