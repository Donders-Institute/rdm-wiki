How do I access existing datasets from previous Donders Institute studies?
***************************************

During this period, you may wish to analyze data from previous studies. 
If one of these previous studies was conducted by a member of the Donders Institute, you can request access to view the raw data - or Data Acquisition Collections (DACs). 
If this study was conducted by a fellow member of the DCCN, you can see the DAC but you cannot view or download the files. 
If the study was conducted by a member of the DCC, DCN, or DCMN, you cannot see the DAC. 
Since you are a member of the Donders Institute, you can request access to privately available DACs, Research Documentation Collections (RDCs), and Data Sharing Collections (DSCs).
