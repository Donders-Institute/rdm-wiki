Why don't we recommend Uploader to move files from our local storage to the Project Storage and DAC?
===========================================================================

.. dropdown:: Answer

    Uploader can upload to both Project Storage and the DAC automatically.
    However, we discourage using this for anything other than experimental data because it automatically formats these files like raw data.
    Therefore, transferring these files separately helps reduce confusion and prevent these files from being lost.


I have uploaded my data to *either* my newly created Project folder or my newly created DAC. What is the easiest way to move this data between the Project folder and the Donders Repository?
==============================================================================================

.. dropdown:: Answer

    Stager. 
    Stager is designed to move files between the Project Folder and Donders Repository. 
    You can upload files from the Project folder to the Repository and download files from the Repository to the Project folder. 

When is Repocli a better tool than Cyberduck for transferring files?
=======================================================================

.. dropdown:: Answer

    Repocli can do everything that Cyberduck can do. 
    It requires fewer steps to use Repocli than it does with Cyberduck. 
    However, many users will prefer Cyberduck because it has a graphical, rather than command line, interface. 
    Repocli is always better than Cyberduck if you can script in BASH. 
    Repocli enables users to download data more efficiently, more specifically, and faster when using scripting. 
    Therefore, Repocli is better whenever it is faster and more reliable for you to script than to simply point-and-click.
