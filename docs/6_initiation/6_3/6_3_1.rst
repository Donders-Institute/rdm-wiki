Accessing Datasets From Online Repositories
******************************************

Thus far we have tackled retrieving publicly and privately available DSCs from the Donders Repository. 
But you may want to download data from other public research data repositories (for a list look at https://neuinfo.org/rin/suggested-data-repositories?p1=SCR_006770).

This data can be downloaded by simply selecting the Download button on websites. 
However, you can also download from these repositories using tools, often with less hassle.
