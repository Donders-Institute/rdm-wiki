How should I move files from my local computer into my (newly issued) Project folder?
*******************************************

If your computer is a part of the Trigon Network, you can simply drag and drop files into the Project folder. 


However, if you are working remote or you want to transfer files on your personal PC, you should NOT use a flash drive. 
Instead, you should upload these files using approved file transfer protocols. 
Using Uploader is not recommended since these files are not experimental data. 
Instead we recommend uploading files to the DAC and Project Folder with Cyberduck.

This is as simple as dragging and dropping files (or however you usually move files around locally)
