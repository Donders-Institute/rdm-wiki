The Purposes of Research Documentation Collections
**********

You may be wondering, if :bdg-primary:`DACs` are for backing up raw data and :bdg-primary:`DSCs` are for sharing results, what do I need an :bdg-primary:`RDC` for?
Well, :bdg-primary:`RDCs` are intended to house the documentation of the analysis process as well as any analyses that you conducted which are not a part of the final manuscript (and therefore not in the :bdg-primary:`DSC` ).
So, beyond the unused analyses, :bdg-primary:`RDCs` should contain information about:

1. How these may have changed over time
2. What you learned through changing these over time
3. Why you each version is the way that it is

Therefore, each time you tinker with your script to try something new out, you should save the version of that script as something new and add to your logs about:

1. What you changed
2. Why you changed it
3. What the results were
4. Your thoughts about what the results mean

This will help improve the :bdg-primary:`FAIR`-ness of your research data, primarily by increasing its *Interoperability*: adding this documentation will allow others who come after you to pick up where you left off. 
Additionally, it will increase the *Reusability* of your data, as the :bdg-primary:`RDC` houses information on the context of your data. 
:bdg-primary:`RDCs` are for (internal) :bdg-warning:`archiving`, meaning that only people given access by one of the collection :bdg-info:`managers` can view this data.

:bdg-primary:`RDCs` can also be used to house the various versions of your manuscript to ensure that these are recorded and traceable after you finish the project.
