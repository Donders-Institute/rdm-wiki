The Interplay Between Research Data Management and Scientific Integrity
************************************************

Brief History
===========
Emerged between 2011-2017 as a consequence of:

1. Little data available via the internet
2. Fraud 
    * Marc Houser (2010)
    * Diederik Stapel (2011)
3. Lack of Standardization
4. Journals' Requirements for Scientific Integrity - Open Science
    * Increased awareness about HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)
    * Repicability Crisis
5. Funding Agencies Requirements 
    * Privacy
    * Data Managment Plans
    * Proper Data Storage Systems
6. Technological Innovations
    * Existing systems and practices had difficulty keeping up with increased resolution (and data size) resulting from increases in imaging quality

Data Stewardship
=============
Since 2017, data stewards occupy the role of:

* Educating, supporting, and monitoring researchers
* Creating policies
* Developing infrastructure 

Takeaways
===========
* Research Data Management is a continuously developing field
* Research Data Management developed to solve problems associated with Scientific Integrity
* For Neuroscientific Research especially, improving Research Data Management practices enables researchers to be more efficient
