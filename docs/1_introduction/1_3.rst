What Practices Promote FAIR Science?
*****************

Adoption of BIDS format and enriching with Metadata are some very powerful ways to make data FAIR. 

Utilizing BIDS Format
=====================
BIDS (or Brain Imaging Data Structure) is the standard directory structure for brain imaging data. This structure is shown below.

``\project\data\subject\session\modality\file.type``

Using BIDS will make your research more FAIR.


Providing Metadata
===================

Your dataset should provide the information necessary to understand and use it: this is called metadata.

The metadata you provide should answer the 5 **W** s:

1. Who - Who comprised your sample?
2. What - What measures did you use?
3. When - What year did you collect the data? 
4. Where - What institute did you collect the data at?
5. Why - What question were you trying to answer?

Providing answers to these questions in the metadata will enable other researchers to determine what they can do with your data.

Archiving Datasets to Public Repositories
================================
When it is possible, you should make your data publicly available. For all Donderians, you will be archiving to http://data.donders.ru.nl
