What Problems does Proper Research Data Managment Mitigate?
**************

Risk of Losing Data
==============
Proper data management practices involve backing data up so that if local copies are lost, the data can still be retrieved

Limited Storage Space
=======================
Proper data management practices ensure that there is the necessary space on local memory

Privacy Violations
===============
Proper data management practices protect the privacy and anonymity of research participants

Non-Reusability
===================
Proper data management practices enable data to be reused by future researchers

Inefficienct Analysis Practices
====================
Proper data managmenent practices free researchers up to do research better, faster, and smarter!
