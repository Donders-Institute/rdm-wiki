Git Facilities
**************

Mention DI organization on GitHub and mention <http://gitlab.socsci.ru.nl> (accessible to anyone with a RU account) and <https://gitlab.science.ru.nl> (only accessible to people with a CNCZ account). The aim is to redirect people to those facilities and teach user to use git for code development.

Very general introduction to git; but pointing users to online tutorials.
