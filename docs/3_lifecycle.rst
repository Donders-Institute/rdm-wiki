The Research Data Life Cycle
***************

This introduces the idea of the research life cycle and how research data has a life cycle which mirrors it. 
We also explain how the life cycle of research data should be explained in a data management plan. 

**The Four Stages of the Research Cycle**
====================
There are 4 stages of research which also mirror the research data life cycle.

**Data Management Plan**
====================

The data management plan outlines *what* data is stored *where* and *when*, *who* has access to the data and *why*?

At the DCCN, we have Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) which have been developed as a guideline which answers these questions for the researcher.

These SOPs were developed for data sets which fall under the blanket ethical approval. 
Read more about the SOPs for Research Data Managment here:
  https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/DCCN/Research/Standard_Operating_Procedures/RDM_compliance_monitoring_SOP_20180621.pdf
 and the SOPs for Preventing Data Leaks here:

If your study does not fall under the blanket ethical approval, you should contact the Data Steward for the DCCN: steven.ligthert@donders.ru.nl

Storage
---------

Moving data between storage facilities intuitively follows the researcher's needs and objectives at each point in the Research Life Cycle.

We will now shift our focus to the tools used to transfer data between data storage facilities.
