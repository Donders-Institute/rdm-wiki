At the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`, you can run technical pilots without going through the project proposal procedure in order to ensure that your stimulus scripts are working correctly, that your experimenters are trained correctly, and that the procedure achieves your goals. 

For the most up-to-date information on what is allowed as a pilot study in the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`, please see the `intranet page on piloting`_.

.. Note::

    If the pilot provides calibration data or results in settings for an experiment, this can also be considered research data for that project. 
    In this case you should consider adding this data to your project files once your :bdg-primary:`Project Folder` has been issued.
