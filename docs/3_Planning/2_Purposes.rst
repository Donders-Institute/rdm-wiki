Purposes of Research Data Management
**********

Without having any data yet, you may be wondering what the purpose of :bdg-success:`RDM` during this stage is. 
These purposes are to: 

1. Run Simulations - "making data up" to answer questions about the validity of using a certain analysis technique
2. Analyze Existing Data - running power or sensitivity analyses to determine sample size, or practicing an analysis technique that you want to employ
3. Create Stimuli Scripts - writing your stimulus code and setting it up to run in the laboratory
4. Run Pilots - acquiring data that is not considered part of your sample
5. Plan Data Management - outlining and committing to :bdg-primary-line:`where` data is stored, :bdg-info-line:`who` has access to :bdg-info-line:`what` files, :bdg-dark-line:`how` data is moved, and :bdg-warning-line:`when` in the timeline of your project. 

Unlike many other research centers, at the :bdg-danger:`DCCN` you will find that our :bdg-warning:`infrastructure` is very straightforward, enabling you to spend more time doing research!
However, proper preparation during the :bdg-info:`Planning Research` stage is still imperative, as it helps to prevent delays in the project's timeeline.  
We will talk specifically about:
