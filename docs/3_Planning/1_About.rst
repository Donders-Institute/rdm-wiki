Planning Research
============

:bdg-secondary:`Planning Research` is, predictably, the very first stage in the Research Life Cycle. 
It includes everything prior to the moment you begin :bdg-secondary:`Collecting Data`: from the earliest stage in conceptualization to the final pilot participant. 
In this section, we'll walk through the majority of :bdg-success:`RDM` issues that you might encounter during the :bdg-secondary:`Planning Research` and how you should handle them when conducting research in the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`.
