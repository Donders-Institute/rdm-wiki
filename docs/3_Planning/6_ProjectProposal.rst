At the :bdg-danger:`DCCN`, we have a very streamlined project approval process for most studies. 
From the moment you have solidified your project plans, the next step is to create a presentation for the :bdg-warning:`Project Proposal Meeting` (PPM). 

Project Proposal Meeting
=======

The purpose of the :bdg-warning:`PPM` is primarily to make sure that your study is scientifically sound enough to proceed (as well as to provide you with feedback to improve it). 
In the presentation, you will discuss the basic design and analysis plan of your study and respond to questions. 
On the intranet, you can read everything you need to know about the `presentation`_ format and guidelines. 

Project Proposal Form
=========

Once you have presented your project, you will fill out the `project proposal form`_. 
Then, you have to wait for these sections to be approved: once approved you will be issued a project number which will allow you to make calendar bookings and collect data.
