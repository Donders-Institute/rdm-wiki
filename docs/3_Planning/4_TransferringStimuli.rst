Moving Stimulus Scripts to Lab Computers
**************

Once your stimulus script works on your local computer, you will want to set it up in the laboratory where you will be running your experiment. 
:bdg-primary:`High Performance Storage` drives (such as the :bdg-primary:`Home Drive`, :bdg-primary:`Project Storage`, :bdg-primary:`Groupshare`) are mounted on lab computers, which means that you can actually run scripts that are stored in these locations. 
However, it is recommended that you set up your stimulus scripts and the files that they use on :bdg-primary:`local storage`, so that if these connections are interrupted your experiment can still be run. 

Location on Local Storage
==========

First, you need to know where you are allowed to store your stimulus materials on the :bdg-primary:`local storage` of the lab PCs.
Your on all lab PCs, you should create a folder within the users folder in the :bdg-primary:`Data` drive (``D:\Users\``) that corresponds to your DCCN username (i.e. firlas). 
Then you can create a folder for your project within your user folder(``D:\Users\firlas\project\``). 
The stimulus script and materials can now be transferred into this folder. 

Transferring Files
==========

Using thumb drives to transfer files onto lap PCs is strongly, strongly discouraged due to potential security risks. 
Therefore, you will have to use data transfer :bdg-dark:`Tools` to achieve this:

1. Zip the folder with your stimulus script and other necessary materials
2. Use a data transfer :bdg-dark:`Tool` to move this zip file from the :bdg-primary:`local storage` of your PC onto your :bdg-primary:`Home Drive`, :bdg-primary:`Project Storage`, or :bdg-primary:`Groupshare`
3. Drag-and-drop the script from :bdg-primary:`High Performance Storage` onto the :bdg-primary:`Data` drive of the lab PC

Ensure Necessary Software
==========

On the lab PCs, only certain softwares are installed. 
If you are using other softwares to run your experiment, you will need to ask the TG to install these on the lab PC for you.
