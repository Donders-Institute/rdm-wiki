Running Simulations
==========

During the preliminary stage of your project, you might need to simulate data in order to determine if an analysis can be run. 
For instance, you may have a computational model and you need to prove that you can recover parameters from the data that they created. 
In this case, you will find that recovering parameters at a certain resolution will take way too long (like days or weeks). 

Let's take a look at how you should go about doing that.
