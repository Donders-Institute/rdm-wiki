Publishing Your Collection
********

.. _how to publish your: https://data.ru.nl/doc/help/helppages/user-manual/archive-publish/publish-dsc.html

Once you are sure that you have completed :bdg-secondary:`Collecting Data` and :bdg-secondary:`Processing Data`, you should :bdg-warning:`publish` the project's :bdg-primary:`DSC`. 
:bdg-warning:`Publishing` these collections means that no more data will be added: this process is final, meaning no further changes can be made. 
Read about `how to publish your`_ :bdg-primary:`DSC` if you haven't already done so before.

Access
=====

The purpose of saving data in a :bdg-primary:`DSC` is to make the data available for sharing. 
However, you will have the option to determining the :bdg-warning:`access` restrictions on your :bdg-primary:`DSC` between 3 options: 

1. :bdg-info:`Open Access` - data is accessible to anyone, without credentials
2. :bdg-info:`Open Access for Registered Users` - data is accessible to anyone who (a) has either an ORCID or SURFContext account and (b) has created an RDR account using their ORCID or SURFContext credentials
3. :bdg-info:`Restricted Access` - collection is viewable to anyone who (a) has either an ORCID or SURFContext account and (b) has created an RDR account using their ORCID or SURFContext credentials but access is given manually by the manager of the collection

State
=====

At various points in the :bdg-secondary:`Archiving Data` stage, your :bdg-primary:`DSC` can be in different :bdg-warning:`states`:

1. :bdg-info:`Editable` - data can be freely uploaded into the :bdg-primary:`DSC` and can be deleted as well
2. :bdg-info:`Internal Review` - the collection can be viewed by those with access to affirm its completeness and data can no longer be uploaded though managers can freely change the state back to :bdg-info:`Editable`
3. :bdg-info:`FAIR Review` - an :bdg-success:`RDM` expert will assess the :bdg-info:`FAIR`-ness of your :bdg-primary:`DSC` and will set your collection either to :bdg-info:`Editable` (if changes are needed) or :bdg-info:`External Review` (if changes are not needed)
4. :bdg-info:`External Review` - the collection can be shared via a URL link to Editors and the state can be freely changed back to :bdg-info:`Internal Review`
5. :bdg-info:`Published` - the :bdg-warning:`state` of the :bdg-primary:`DSC` can not be changed and therefore the contents of the :bdg-primary:`DSC` cannot be changed

In all :bdg-warning:`states` it is possible to download from the :bdg-primary:`DSC`

.. Note::

    Once your :bdg-primary:`DSC` is published, if you need to alter it you must contact the :bdg-danger:`RU` central ICT desk to request a new version of the :bdg-primary:`DSC`. 
    This often takes several days to complete, so it is always best to be sure before you set your :bdg-primary:`DSC` to :bdg-info:`Published`.
