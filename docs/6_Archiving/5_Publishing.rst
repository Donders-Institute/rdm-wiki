Once you are sure that you have completed :bdg-secondary:`Collecting Data` and :bdg-secondary:`Processing Data`, you should :bdg-warning:`publish` the project's :bdg-primary:`DSC`. 
The purpose of a :bdg-primary:`DSC` is to supports the final results that have made it to a publication, so you should :bdg-warning:`publish`` data when the results of the project are final - no sooner and no later. 
This is because :bdg-warning:`publishing` these collections means that no more data will be added: this process is final, meaning no further changes can be made. 
Read about `how to publish your`_ :bdg-primary:`DSC` if you haven't already done so before. 

Prior to archiving data, it is **crucial** to first :bdg-warning:`check data integrity`. You can `read how to check data integrity here`_.

Access
=====

The purpose of saving data in a :bdg-primary:`DSC` is to make the data available for sharing. 
However, you will have the option to determining the :bdg-warning:`access` restrictions on your :bdg-primary:`DSC`. 
Read about `various access roles here`_.

State
=====

At different points in the :bdg-secondary:`Archiving Data` stage, your :bdg-primary:`DSC` can be in different :bdg-warning:`states`:
Read about `various collection states here`_.
In all :bdg-warning:`states` it is possible to download from the :bdg-primary:`DSC`

.. Note::

    Once your :bdg-primary:`DSC` is published, if you need to alter it you must contact the :bdg-danger:`RU` central ICT desk to request a new version of the :bdg-primary:`DSC`. 
    This often takes several days to complete, so it is always best to be sure before you set your :bdg-primary:`DSC` to :bdg-info:`Published`.
