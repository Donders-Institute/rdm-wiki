Once you are sure that you have completed :bdg-secondary:`Collecting Data` you should :bdg-warning:`archive` the project's :bdg-primary:`DAC`.
And, after you have finished :bdg-secondary:`Processing Data`, you should archive your :bdg-primary:`RDC`. 
:bdg-warning:`Archiving` these collections makes them read-only: it means that no more data can be added or removed and that the data collections enters a pre-defined preservation period. :bdg-primary:`DACs` and :bdg-primary:`RDCs` are closed collection types, meaning that the data contained in them will not be publicly shared.
Thus, these collections can only be set to :bdg-warning:`Closed Access` - you will have the option to set metadata visible to non-viewers though. 
Since the data is :bdg-warning:`Closed Access`, only managers, contributors, and viewers can access and download the data.

Prior to archiving data, it is **crucial** to first :bdg-warning:`check data integrity`. You can `read how to check data integrity here`_.

Read about `how to archive your`_ :bdg-primary:`DAC` or :bdg-primary:`RDC` if you haven't already done so before.

.. Warning::

    Although they are always :bdg-warning:`Closed Access`, data in these :bdg-primary:`DACs` must be pseudonymized. 
    You can never archive administrative personal data of research participants (which include e.g. emails, names, phone numbers, or SONA IDs) in a :bdg-primary:`DAC` or :bdg-primary:`RDC` - these should always be kept strictly separated from the research data.
