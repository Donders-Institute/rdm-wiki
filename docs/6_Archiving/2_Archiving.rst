Archiving Your Collection

.. _how to archive your: https://data.ru.nl/doc/help/helppages/user-manual/archive-publish/archive-dac-rdc.html

Once you are sure that you have completed :bdg-secondary:`Collecting Data` and :bdg-secondary:`Processing Data`, you should :bdg-warning:`archive` the project's :bdg-primary:`DAC` and :bdg-primary:`RDC`. 
:bdg-warning:`Archiving` these collections is akin to publishing them: it means that no more data will be added. 
However, the process is called :bdg-archiving:`archiving` because these collections are kept for internal purposes instead of public sharing. 
Thus, these collections can only be set to :bdg-warning:`Closed Accesss`` - you will have the option to set metadata visible to non-viewers though. 

Read about `how to archive your`_ :bdg-primary:`DAC` or :bdg-primary:`RDC` if you haven't already done so before.

.. Warning::

    Although they are always :bdg-warning:`Closed Accesss`, you **CANNOT** include potentially identfying data in these :bdg-primary:`DACs`. 
    This especially includes documents which include emails, names, phone numbers, or SONA IDs: these may never be stored with research data.
