About
==========
An automatic data transfer protocol has been created for both MRI and MEG data. 
This process will format your raw MRI/MEG data according to BIDS standards in your project's Project Folder and DAC.

Making a Calendar booking
===========
This automatic workflow starts with making a calendar booking at https://portal.dccn.nl.

In the calendar booking, you will request a timeslot for either one of the three MRI scanners or the MEG laboratory.

You will be asked to assign the data collected in this timeslot a unique combination of subject and session numbers. 
This subject and session number will determine where this subjects' data is saved to in the Project Folder and DAC.

Where to Find Automatically Uploaded Data
=================
If XXX is the subject number you assigned to a slot during calendar booking and YY is the session number:

MRI data will be found in the Project storage at ``\project\1234567.89\raw\sub-XXX\ses-mriYY\``.
MEG data will be found in the Project storage at ``\project\1234567.89\raw\sub-XXX\ses-megYY\``.

Booking is Not Enough
===============
Although booking the lab is necessary to enable automatic data transfer, data collected during that slot will **NOT** automatically be uploaded anywhere. 
You **MUST** collect your booking at the MRI/MEG console.
