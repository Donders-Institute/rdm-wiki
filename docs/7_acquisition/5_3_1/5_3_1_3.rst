Collect the Calendar Booking
===================
Prior to collecting any images, you must pick up your calendar booking from the MRI scheduler. 

First go to {insert path to calender booking}. 
Then, click on the folder with your project number and the subject-session combination assigned to your current timeslot.

Ensure Transfer is Underway
===================
Before leaving the scanner, you should ensure that the automatic transfer is underway. 
To do this, navigate to {insert path to automatic transfer progress}.

If the automatc transfer is in progress, you can leave it. 
Otherwise, {ask Paul}.

Powering Off the MRI console
---------------
If you:

a. Have the last MRI session of the day AND it is past 6PM on a weekday - or -
b. Are scanning on a weekend AND the next lab user is not present

YOU are responsible for Powering the MRI console off. 
However, you must wait until all data has been transferred from the MRI console before turning it off. 
If you fail to do this, you will lose all files which have not been successfully transferred. 

To check on the progress of the automatic transfer, navigate to {insert path to automatic transfer progress}.
