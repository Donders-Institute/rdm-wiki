RDM in a nutshell
*****************

Research Data Management (RDM) aims to improve the research efficiency and transparency, and to fulfill the requirements of the university, funders, and legislation. The Donders Institute uses this repository for data management. The repository serves three purposes:

* Data preservation for internal reuse
* Research documentation for increasing reusability and reproducibility
* Data sharing with the external scientific community
