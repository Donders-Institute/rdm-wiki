**Accessible** - data collections are retrievable by their identifier, the protocol for access is open and free, and the protocol allows for authentication and authorization when necessary

**Interoperable** - data collections use appropriate formal shared language and include qualified references to other data collections

**Reusable** - data collections have accurate and relevant attributes, clear and accesible data usage license, and meet domain-relevant community standards
