Groupshare
**********

For Windows PCs connected to the Trigon Network, this is the ``G:\`` drive (look under "Network" in File Explorer). 
For VNC Sessions on the HPC Cluster, this is the ``/group/`` folder. 

The Group directory enables passive data sharing between members of a laboratory group. 
All lab group members have read-write access, meaning that they can read, create, delete, move, copy, and edit files located in the group directory. 
Therefore, using the groupshare is ideal for use cases such as having a fellow lab member run your analysis script to check for mistakes.

Your home directory will be located at ``G:\groupname\`` on Windows PCs connected to the Trigon and the ``/group/groupname/`` on the HPC Cluster.
