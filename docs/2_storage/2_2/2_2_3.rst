Groupshare
**********

Purpose
==========
To enable passive data sharing between members of a laboratory group. 
Also, it can serve the purpose of housing your pseudonymization keys when multiple researchers need access to it. 

Location
============
Your group directory will be located at ``G:\groupname\`` on Windows PCs connected to the Trigon and the ``/groupshare/groupname/`` on the HPC Cluster. 

Procedure to Obtain
=============
After you have signed in at the DCCN you will be given access to any group(s) which you are registered with.

Quota
=======
There is no quota on the groupshare because you cannot keep research data files on it.
