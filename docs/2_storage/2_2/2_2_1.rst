Project Storage
********
For Windows PCs connected to the Trigon Network, this is the ``P:\`` drive (look under "Network" in File Explorer). 
For VNC Sessions on the HPC Cluster, this is the ``/project/`` folder. 

Research at DCCN is organized by projects. 
Projects are assigned numbers after the Project Proposal Form is completed and approved.

Project numbers are given in the format ``1234567.89``. 
Your project's data will be located at ``P:\1234567.89\`` on Windows PCs connected to the Trigon and the ``/project/1234567.89/`` on the HPC Cluster.

Based on the storage you request in the Project Proposal Form, you will be given a quota of storage which cannot be exceeded in your project's folder.
Each research project, once approved, will be provided with a quota on the DCCN central storage allowing researchers to store and process the research data related to the project.
