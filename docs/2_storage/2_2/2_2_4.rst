Scientific Datasets
***************

Scientific datasets are large, freely shared datasets which many researchers in the DCCN might have an interest in using. 
In order to prevent users from having to download these large datasets by themselves, the scientific datasets are kept on Central Storage. 
When a researcher wishes to analyze this data, they can receive a project folder and will be granted read-only access to the scientific dataset. 
Thus, they can analyze the data and save the output as a file in their project folder without having to download the data themselves or changing the data in the scientific dataset.
