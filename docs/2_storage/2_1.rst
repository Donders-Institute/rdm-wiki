Local Storage
**********************

Using local storage is highly risky. 
Computers can crash and data can accidentally be deleted at any time. 
However, many instances may require you to use local storage. 

When using a Windows PC with a wired connection to the Trigon Network, you are able to drag and drop files from Local Storage (i.e. from the ``C:/`` drive and ``D:/`` drive) to Central Storage. 
You also have read-write access to files in the Central Storage. 
This means that you can directly edit and write files on Central Storage from file explorer. 
Central Storage is much, much less risky than local storage. 
Therefore, it is important to be aware of when you are using local storage and when you are using Central Storage. 

Lab Computers
==============
Lab Computers include all of the computers located in the various laboratories at the DCCN (i.e. behavioral, MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.). 
Formerly, Lab Computers were not connected to the Trigon network. 
This has recently changed. 
Therefore, Lab Computers have network access to the Central Storage facilities at the DCCN. 
However, by default data will be written to local storage on Lab Computers.

Network Desktops
============
Network Desktops are the Windows Desktops which are located at Flex Desks, the Instruction Room, and the Trainee Room. 
All Network Desktops are connected to the Trigon Network and therefore have access to the Central Storage facilities at the DCCN. 
However, by default data will be written to local storage on Lab Computers.

TG Issued Laptops
==============
TG Issued Laptops are the DELL Laptops issued by the TG. 
When Docked at the DCCN, TG Issued Laptops are connected to the Trigon Network and therefore have access to the Central Storage facilities at the DCCN. 
However, by default data will be written to local storage on the Laptop.

Personal Computer
===============
Under no circumstances can a wired connection between your personal computer and Trigon Network be established.
