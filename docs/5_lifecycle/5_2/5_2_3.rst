How do I access publicly available data sets from external institutions?
******************************************

Thus far we have tackled retrieving publicly and privately available DSCs from the Donders Repository. 
But you may want to download data from other public research data repositories. 

This data can be downloaded by simply selecting the Download button on websites. 
If you use some web browser, you can for instance find data in repositories (for a list look at https://neuinfo.org/rin/suggested-data-repositories?p1=SCR_006770). 

However, these data sets are obviously quite large (often >100 GB). 
Downloading 100 GB of files will take quite some time. 
More importantly, you might not have the memory required to download this much data: therefore, you should only download it if you need it. 
It can be tedious and prone to errror to download this by "pointing and clicking". 
Let's try using Repocli to selectively download a subset of data files from one such repository into our Home Folder.
