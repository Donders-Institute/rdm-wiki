The FAIR Acronym
================
**Findable** - data collections are assigned an *ETERNALLY* perisistent identifer (DOI), described with rich metadata, and are registered in a searchable resource (i.e. a repository)

**Accessible** - data collections are retrievable by their identifier, the protocol for access is open and free, and the protocol allows for authentication and authorization when necessary

**Interoperable** - data collections use appropriate formal shared language and include qualified references to other data collections

**Reusable** - data collections have accurate and relevant attributes, clear and accesible data usage license, and meet domain-relevant community standards

The workflows developed for researchers at the DCCN are aimed at making research FAIR.
