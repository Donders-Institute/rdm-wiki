.. _`stage all of the processed data files and the analysis data files into your Project's DSC`: https://rdm.dccn.nl/docs/excercises/09.html

During this stage, you will need to `stage all of the processed data files and the analysis data files into your Project's DSC`_. 
If you need to request a DSC, fill out `this form`_. 

We strongly recommended using Stager for this purpose since it is easy to use; however, you can also use Cyberduck or Repocli.

After you have brought all of your files into the DSC, you will then need to publish your data sharing collection.
