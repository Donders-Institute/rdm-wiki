How should I move files from my local computer into my (newly issued) Project folder?

If your computer is a part of the Trigon Network, you can simply drag and drop files into the Project folder. 


However, if you are working remote or you want to transfer files on your personal PC, you should NOT use a flash drive. 
Instead, you should upload these files using approved file transfer protocols. 
Using Uploader is not recommended since these files are not experimental data. 
Instead we recommend uploading files `Uploading to the Project Folder`_ and `Uploading to the Radboud Data Repository`_, with Cyberduck for instance.
Alternatively, you can drag and drop files from your Home Directory by using File Explorer - though this is only recommended for small batches of files.
