How do I access existing datasets from Online Repositories?
******************************************

.. _`download from these repositories using tools`: https://rdm.dccn.nl/docs/excercises/03.html
.. _`other public research data repositories`: https://neuinfo.org/rin/suggested-data-repositories?p1=SCR_006770

Thus far we have tackled retrieving publicly and privately available DSCs from the Radboud Data Repository. 
But you may want to download data from `other public research data repositories`_.

This data can be downloaded by simply selecting the Download button on websites. 
However, you can also `download from these repositories using tools`_, often with less hassle.
