`Scientific datasets` are large research datasets which are either managed by a Principal Investigator or the DCCN Data Steward. 
The reason that the DCCN offers this service is because these datasets are very big, very costly, and are cutting-edge research projects. 
Thus, since many researchers at the DCCN have interest in these project datasets, it is far more time-efficient to have these datasets already saved on site.
